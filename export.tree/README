This meditation experiment contains 24 subjects. Subjects were
meditating and were interupted about every 2 minutes to indicate
their level of concentration and mind wandering. The scientific
article (see Reference) contains all methodological details.

Note that although the original files were recorded at 2048 Hz, they were downsampled to 256 Hz using the BDF decimator provided by BIOSEMI (https://www.biosemi.com/download.htm).
